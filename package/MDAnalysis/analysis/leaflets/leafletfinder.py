class LeafletFinder(object):
    """Identify atoms in the same leaflet of a lipid bilayer.

    You can use a predefined method ("graph", "spectralclustering" or
    "center_of_geometry"). Alternatively, you can pass in your own function
    as a method. This *must* accept an array of coordinates as the first
    argument, and *must* return either a list of numpy arrays (the
    ``components`` attribute) or a tuple of (list of numpy arrays,
    predictor object). The numpy arrays should be arrays of indices of the
    input coordinates, such that ``k = components[i][j]`` means that the
    ``k``th coordinate belongs to the ``i-th`` leaflet.
    The class will also pass the following keyword arguments to your function:
    ``cutoff``, ``box``, ``return_predictor``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    universe : Universe or AtomGroup
        Atoms to apply the algorithm to
    select : str
        A :meth:`Universe.select_atoms` selection string
        for atoms that define the lipid head groups, e.g.
        universe.atoms.PO4 or "name PO4" or "name P*"
    cutoff : float (optional)
        cutoff distance for computing distances (for the spectral clustering
        method) or determining connectivity in the same leaflet (for the graph
        method). In spectral clustering, it just has to be suitably large to
        cover a significant part of the leaflet, but lower values increase
        computational efficiency. Please see the :func:`optimize_cutoff`
        function for help with values for the graph method. A cutoff is not
        used for the "center_of_geometry" method.
    pbc : bool (optional)
        If ``False``, does not follow the minimum image convention when
        computing distances
    method: str or function (optional)
        method to use to assign groups to leaflets. Choose
        "graph" for :func:`~distances.group_coordinates_by_graph`;
        "spectralclustering" for
        :func:`~distances.group_coordinates_by_spectralclustering`;
        "center_of_geometry" for
        :func:`~distances.group_coordinates_by_cog`;
        "orientation" to calculate orientations for each lipid and
        use :func:`~distances.group_vectors_by_orientation`
        or alternatively, pass in your own method. This *must* accept an
        array of coordinates as the first argument, and *must*
        return either a list of numpy arrays (the ``components``
        attribute) or a tuple of (list of numpy arrays, predictor object).
    calculate_orientations: bool (optional)
        if your custom method requires the orientation vector of each lipid,
        set ``calculate_orientations=True`` and an Nx3 array of orientation
        vectors will get passed into your function with the keyword
        ``orientation``. This is set to ``True`` for ``method="orientation"``.
    **kwargs:
        Passed to ``method``


    Attributes
    ----------
    universe: Universe
    select: str
        Selection string
    selection: AtomGroup
        Atoms that the analysis is applied to
    headgroups: List of AtomGroup
        Atoms that the analysis is applied to, grouped by residue.
    pbc: bool
        Whether to use PBC or not
    box: numpy.ndarray or None
        Cell dimensions to use in calculating distances
    predictor:
        The object used to group the leaflets. :class:`networkx.Graph` for
        ``method="graph"``; :class:`sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering` for
        ``method="spectralclustering"``; or :class:`numpy.ndarray` for
        ``method="center_of_geometry"``.
    positions: numpy.ndarray (N x 3)
        Array of positions of headgroups to use. If your selection has
        multiple atoms for each residue, this is the center of geometry.
    orientations: numpy.ndarray (N x 3) or None
        Array of orientation vectors calculated with ``lipid_orientation``.
    components: list of numpy.ndarray
        List of indices of atoms in each leaflet, corresponding to the
        order of `selection`. ``components[i]`` is the array of indices
        for the ``i``-th leaflet. ``k = components[i][j]`` means that the
        ``k``-th atom in `selection` is in the ``i``-th leaflet.
        The components are sorted by size for the "spectralclustering" and
        "graph" methods. For the "center_of_geometry" method, they are
        sorted by the order that the centers are passed into the class.
    groups: list of AtomGroups
        List of AtomGroups in each leaflet. ``groups[i]`` is the ``i``-th
        leaflet. The components are sorted by size for the "spectralclustering"
        and "graph" methods. For the "center_of_geometry" method, they are
        sorted by the order that the centers are passed into the class.
    leaflets: list of AtomGroup
        List of AtomGroups in each leaflet. ``groups[i]`` is the ``i``-th
        leaflet. The leaflets are sorted by z-coordinate so that the
        upper-most leaflet is first.
    sizes: list of ints
        List of the size of each leaflet in ``groups``.


    Example
    -------
    The components of the graph are stored in the list
    :attr:`LeafletFinder.components`; the atoms in each component are numbered
    consecutively, starting at 0. To obtain the atoms in the input structure
    use :attr:`LeafletFinder.groups`::

       L = LeafletFinder(PDB, 'name P*')
       leaflet_1 = L.groups[0]
       leaflet_2 = L.groups[1]

    The residues can be accessed through the standard MDAnalysis mechanism::

       leaflet_1.residues

    provides a :class:`~MDAnalysis.core.groups.ResidueGroup`
    instance. Similarly, all atoms in the first leaflet are then ::

       leaflet_1.residues.atoms
